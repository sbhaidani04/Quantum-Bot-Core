## Description
This is a project that allowed me to integrate a messaging system in real-time and test it using an API testing workspace, Postman. This is a beginner mission done during my internship with Radical AI with the aim of getting familiar with various tools.

## Tools Used
Firebase, JavaScript, Postman

## Running Instructions
Export all functions to Firebase using _firebase deploy --only functions_. Then, setup API testing workspace by connecting Postman to Firebase. 

## Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge the Radical AI Team for their tutorial videos.
